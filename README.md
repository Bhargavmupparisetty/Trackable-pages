# Trackable Pages

## Overview
**Trackable Pages** is a web-based tool that allows you to track the location, device information, and IP address of a person by sharing a unique link. The system is designed to create a duplicate URL from any legitimate website URL you enter. When the target clicks the link, they are seamlessly redirected to the legitimate page while the tracking information is sent to your server. This can be used for security purposes, user behavior tracking, or any other legitimate use case where tracking is necessary.

## How It Works
1. Enter the URL of a legitimate website in the provided input area.
2. A unique, duplicate URL is generated for you to share with someone.
3. When the recipient opens the link:
   - They are redirected to the legitimate website.
   - Meanwhile, details like their location, device information, and IP address are sent to the server for logging and analysis.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Tracking**: Captures location, device information, and IP address as soon as the link is accessed.
- **Seamless Redirection**: The recipient is automatically redirected to the legitimate URL without any interruptions.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simply input a URL and get a trackable link with no extra steps.
- **No User Awareness**: The recipient is unaware of the tracking process as they are instantly taken to the legitimate site.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the front-end structure and UI elements.
- **JavaScript**: To handle link generation and tracking processes.
- **Node.js**: For backend handling, including the tracking mechanism and server-side operations.
